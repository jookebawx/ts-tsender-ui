This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Environment Variables

Before running `pnpm build` or deploying you must configure a WalletConnect project ID.
Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example` and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID` to your WalletConnect project ID.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# edit .env.local and add your project id
```


## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

When hosting the project on GitHub Pages the site is served from the repository subdirectory. `next.config.ts` is configured so that when `NODE_ENV` is `"production"` the `basePath` becomes `/ts-tsender-ui` and `assetPrefix` becomes `/ts-tsender-ui/`. These values are required for assets and links to resolve correctly on GitHub Pages.
